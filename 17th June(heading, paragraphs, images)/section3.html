<h2>Morning ðŸŒ…<br>
</h2> 
<p align ="center"><em> My morning begins at <del>6:30 AM</del> <ins>7:00 AM</ins> when I wake up and get ready for the day. I start by brushing my teeth and freshening up. After that, I do a few minutes of stretching or light exercise to feel energized. I then enjoy a healthy breakfast, usually consisting of toast, fruit, or cereal. Once Iâ€™m done, I review my tasks for the day and prepare for my classes or work.

<h2>AfternoonðŸ•‘</h2>
<p align = "center"><i>In the afternoon, I focus on my studies or assignments. I usually attend lectures or complete my homework during this time. After a productive session, I take a break to have lunch around 1:00 PM. If time allows, I also take a short walk or relax by listening to music. This helps me stay focused and refreshed for the rest of the day.

<h2>EveningðŸŒƒ</h2>
<p align ="center"><em>My evening routine starts after 6:00 PM. I like to unwind by reading a book or spending time with my family. Sometimes, I go out with friends or catch up on a favorite show. Around 8:00 PM, I have dinner and finish any leftover tasks. Before going to bed, I spend a few minutes journaling or reflecting on the day. I usually sleep by 10:30 PM to get enough rest for the next day.
