            <p>
              <em><u>Writing is my favourite hobby because it allows me to express my thoughts, emotions, and ideas freely. &nbsp;Whenever I write, I feel a sense of calm and clarity. Whether it's journaling, storytelling, or poetry, writing gives me a creative outlet to explore the world around me and my own inner self. It helps me organise my thoughts and develop a deeper understanding of various topics and situations.Apart from being a fun activity, writing has also improved my vocabulary, grammar, and communication skills.</b> <i>It has taught me to think critically and observe the small details that others might miss. Through writing, I can capture memories, create new worlds, and connect with people on a deeper level. It is more than just a pastime; it is a part of who I am and something I enjoy doing every day.</u>
            </em></p> 
            <p><em><u>Writing also boosts my confidence. Whenever I complete a piece—whether it’s a short story, a diary entry, or an article—I feel a sense of achievement. Sharing my work with others and receiving feedback helps me grow and improve. Over time, I’ve learned that writing isn't just about using perfect words; it’s about being honest, creative, and thoughtful. This hobby has become my way of exploring new ideas and expressing myself in a meaningful way.</u></em></p>
